# Ph 220: Quantum Learning Theory (Fall 2025)

**Class meetings:** Monday & Wednesday, 1:00pm‚Äì2:20pm in 387 Linde Hall.

---

## Overview üìñ

This course covers quantum learning theory, a contemporary field at the intersection of quantum mechanics, quantum computing, statistical learning theory, and machine learning. The fundamental questions explored include: how to efficiently learn quantum many-body systems? When can quantum machines learn and predict better than classical machines? What physical phenomena can quantum machines learn and discover? The course aims to develop rigorous theoretical foundations for understanding how scientists, machines, and future quantum computers can learn and discover new phenomena in our quantum-mechanical universe.

**Prerequisites:** Ph 125 ab or equivalent.

## Grading & Homework Policy üìù

This course can be taken **pass/fail** or for a **letter grade**. A passing grade requires a final score of at least 60%.

There will be **five problem sets** posted every two weeks. The grade will be based on the correctness, completeness, and clarity of your proofs.

#### Homework Due Dates (Tentative):
1.  **HW 1:** Friday, October 17th
2.  **HW 2:** Friday, October 31st
3.  **HW 3:** Friday, November 14th
4.  **HW 4:** Friday, November 28th
5.  **HW 5:** Friday, December 12th

#### Submission & Extension Policy:
* Please submit your homework in **PDF format**. You can use LaTeX or scan handwritten solutions.
* You have **two automatic 4-day extensions** for the term. Please indicate on the first page of your solution if you are using an extension.
* Additional extensions may be granted for legitimate reasons; please ask the TA in advance.
* There is a **25% penalty** for missing a deadline without an extension. Late homework is generally accepted up to one week after the original due date.

## Collaboration & Academic Integrity ‚úÖ

* Discussing course materials and homework problems with others is encouraged. However, **you must write up your solutions on your own**.
* Do not share complete solutions. Please acknowledge your collaborators and give proper credit to others whose ideas you are using.
* Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to learn material or fill in background knowledge. **Do not copy homework solutions generated by LLMs.** The proofs produced by LLMs are often incorrect, incomplete, or tautological.
